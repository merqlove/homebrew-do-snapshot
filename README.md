Homebrew-Do-Snapshot
====================
These formulae duplicate software provided by OS X, though may provide more recent or bugfix versions.

How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap merqlove/homebrew-do-snapshot` and then `brew install do_snapshot`.

If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you can `brew install merqlove/homebrew-do-snapshot/do_snapshot`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.github.com/merqlove/homebrew-do-snapshot/master/do_snapshot.rb
```
